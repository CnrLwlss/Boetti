<p>Last week I enjoyed seeing the pixel tapestry above, made by Alighiero Boetti in 1977.  These were a 10x10 array of panels, each made of 10x10 squares, which I am calling pixels.  Obviously these were not pixels on a screen, but squares on a tapestry, but the concept is similar.  Background and foreground colours alternate from black to white moving through the panels from left to right and top to bottom.  In the top left hand panel, there are 100 background (black) and 0 foreground (white) pixels.  In the next panel there are 99 background (white) and 1 foreground (black) pixels, the next has 98 background (black) and 2 foreground (white) and so on until in the final panel there is only 1 background and 99 foreground pixels.  Boetti often made pattern-based art which constrained the artist in one sense, but left the artist almost infinite possibilities in another.  In this case there are many different ways that the pixels could be arranged across the 100 panels while obeying this schema.  He was also interested in concocting sets of rules which he convinced other people to follow in order to make his art.  So, here I am following some of his rules.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time thinking about pixels during my <a href="http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/conor.lawless/">research</a> and that probably explains why I like thinking about the structure of the tapestry.  The pattern going from foreground domination to background domination is quite satisfying, as are the three levels of squareness.</p>

<p>Boetti made the patterns in the tapestry above by hand and some panels seem ordered and some seem random.  But of course, fully random patterns do occasionally look ordered, by chance.  Boetti made this particular tapestry early in his career and later on he encouraged other artists to work on the same schema, and so there were also series of rugs made according to the same schema by people under Boetti's direction at <a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/boetti/">MOMA</a>.</p>

<p>I wondered how these would look if each panel was generated according to a specific rule?  Particularly if panels were generated by a random process, or indeed if each panel was just randomly generated?  Why did Boetti choose to work exclusively with the dimensions 10x10?  Although the number 10 has obvious importance in the decimal numbering system, the one we use most often for counting, using 10 as a base for a number system is arbitrary and probably doesn't have any particular visual importance and so I wondered what would these patterns look like drawn with different dimensions (NxN squares, for any value of N)?  I quickly hacked together these Python functions to explore further.</p>

<p>The functions work by generating an N*NxN*N array representing each pixel in each panel and applying pixel colours in each row i and column j of each panel in row I and panel J of the pattern, where each of i,j,I and J are in the range 0,...,N.</p>

<p>There are three functions which update the next panel in the series (left to right, top to bottom) according to current row and column number (I,J) and the pixels in the previous panel (represented within an array called <i>pixels</i>).  Currently, these three functions either generate completely random positions for foreground pixels (<i>randomPositions</i>) in each panel, generate a random progression of pixels from one panel to the next (<i>randomProgress</i>) or randomly position the first pixel and try to place all subsequent pixels as close as possible to all previous pixels (<i>nearest</i>).  It is straightforward to extend this to other rule-based patterns.  You can see some example output below, or just grab the code and make your own.</p>
