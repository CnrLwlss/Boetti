<p>Python functions to produce Alighiero Boetti type progressions (as in Alternando da uno a cento e viceversa (Alternating from one to one hundred and vice versa)).  Here's a photo I took of some rugs following this progression <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/conchur/7758559520">here</a> and there are some images from an exhibition in the Mueseum Of Modern Art in New York, New York <a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/boetti/">here</a><a></a>.</p>

<p>Last week I enjoyed seeing the pixel tapestries above, made by Alighiero Boetti in 1977.  These were made of a 10x10 array of alternating black and white panels, each made of 10x10 squares, which I am calling pixels.  Obviously these were not pixels on a screen, but squares on a tapestry, but the concept is the same.  Starting with the first pixel, in the top left hand panel, there are 100 background (black) and 0 foreground (white) pixels.  In the next panel there are 99 background (white) and 1 foreground (black) pixels, the next has 98 background (black) and 2 foreground (white) and so on until in the final panel there is only 1 background and 99 foreground pixels.  Boetti liked pattern-based art which constrained the artist in one sense, but left the artist almost infinite possibilities in another.  In this case there are many different ways that the pixels could be arranged across the 100 panels while obeying this schema.</p>

<p>I liked the tapestries, perhaps because I spend a lot of time thinking about pixels.  The pattern going from foreground domination to background domination is quite satisfying, as are the three levels of squareness.  Boetti made one tapestry early in his career and later on in his career he encouraged other artists to work on the same schema, and there were a series of rugs made according to the same schema by people under Boetti's direction at <a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/boetti/">MOMA</a><a></a>.</p>

<p>Boetti made the patterns by hand and some are obviously ordered and some seem random.  I wondered how these would look if each panel was generated according to a specific rule.  Particularly if panels were generated by a random process, or indeed if each panel was just randomly generated.  Another thing I wondered was why he chose to work exclusively with the dimensions 10x10.  Although the number 10 has obvious importance in the decimal numbering system, the one we use most often for counting, using 10 as a base for a number system is arbitrary and probably just based on the number of fingers the average human has.  It doesn't really have any particular visual importance and so I wondered what these patterns would look like drawn with different dimensions (arbitrary NxN squares).  For these two reasons I quickly hacked together these Python functions to explore further.</p>

<p>The functions work by generating an N*NxN*N array representing each pixel and applying pixel colours in each row i and column j of each panel in row I and panel J of the pattern, where each of i,j,I and J are in the range 0,...,N.</p>

<p>There are three functions which update the next panel in the series (left to right, top to bottom) according to current row and column number (I,J) and the pixels in each panel (represented by an array called <i>pixels</i>.  Currently, these three functions generate completely random positions for foreground pixels (<i>randomPositions</i>) in each panel, generate a random progression of pixels from one panel to the next (<i>randomProgress</i>) or randomly position the first pixel and try to place all subsequent pixels as close as possible to all previous pixels (<i>nearest</i>).  It is straightforward to extend this to other rule-based patterns.</p>
